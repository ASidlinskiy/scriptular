# Scriptular

A clone of [Rubular](http://rubular.com) for javascript regular expressions.

*Disclaimer:* Probably has a ton of bugs, this is just a first pass.
*Another Disclaimer:* This whole project can be simplified a lot, I'm using ruby and node for development, which really isn't needed.

## Running for development

* clone the repo
* npm install
* bundle
* foreman start


## CONTRIBUTE

If you'd like to hack on Twelve, start by forking the repo on GitHub:

The best way to get your changes merged back into core is as follows:

1. Clone down your fork
1. Create a thoughtfully named topic branch to contain your change
1. Hack away
1. Add tests and make sure everything still passes by running `bundle exec rake`
1. If you are adding new functionality, document it in the README
1. Do not change the version number, we will do that on our end
1. If necessary, rebase your commits into logical chunks, without errors
1. Push the branch up to GitHub
1. Send a pull request for your branch
